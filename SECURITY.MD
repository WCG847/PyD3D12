# Python Direct3D12 Bindings Security Policy
____________________________________________
## Proper Avenue For Report
If you experience any errors or security issues with the Python Direct3D12 Bindings, please report them to the project maintainers via the project's issue tracker on GitHub.
However, Direct3D 12, DirectX Ultimate, and DXGI are all proprietary technologies owned by Microsoft, and many issues are out of our hands. If the issue is nothing to do with our plugin, report it appropriately using Microsoft's tools, including:
- [DirectX Feedback](https://aka.ms/directxfeedback)
- [Windows Error Reporting (WER)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wer/windows-error-reporting)
- [Windows Insider Program](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/)
- [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/)
- [Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN)](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-us/home?forum=windowsdirectx)
- [Microsoft Q&A](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/topics/windows-directx.html)
- [DirectX Discord](https://discord.gg/directx)

Additionally, some issues may not be at fault of either the plugin or Microsoft, but rather the hardware or drivers. In these cases, you should report the issue to your hardware vendor or driver provider (especially GPU). Common supports include:
- [NVIDIA Support](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/support/)
- [AMD Support](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
- [Intel Support](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support.html)
- [ARM Support](https://developer.arm.com/support)

## Serious Vulnerabilities
If you discover a serious vulnerability in the Python Direct3D12 Bindings, please contact the maintainers directly via email or private message on GitHub. We will work with you to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.
Rarely, a vulnerability may be related to Microsoft and not the plugin itself. In this case, we will work with Microsoft to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.
